Can use command prompt by changing directory to folder with files, simply cd Directory\Folder followed by enter. Type dir to see contents. Type python filename.py to execute. Complex resource intense programs are good to check in the command prompt since it runs without any kind of interpreting or compiling.

ideas: portfolio website, programs that project paths based on multiple dimensions and values, analytical programs or working for companies that make those (e.g. segment), sales sites, warehousing, document control systems
